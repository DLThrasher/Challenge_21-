# Challenge_21-


In this challenge  I created a ERC20 token that is to be minted using a Crowdsale contract. The contract mangages the crowdsale process. Users will be able to send ether to the contract and receive the native token in return. The contract will auto mint the tokens and distribute them to the buyers.
